# verbatim-name-filter

takes a text string and selects data records matching that string anywhere in the VerbatimScientificName field

A Data Source and Map must be configured. The Feature Service URL is currently hardcoded.

A framework filter change message is published with each selection so this widget must be configured in the builder environment to publish to all interested widgets.

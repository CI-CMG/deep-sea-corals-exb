# scientific-name-autocomplete

widget which uses Material UI autocomplete widget to provide a selector to choose a single scientific name to filter the map.
The list is populated from an external [configuration file](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/waf/dsc-data/config/DeepSeaCorals/scientific_names.json) so the list of available selections does not change based on map extent or other filters.

This widget must be configured with a DataSource and to publish framework filter change events to other interested widgets.

Due to the mui dependency, 'npm install' must be run in the widget's directory before use.
